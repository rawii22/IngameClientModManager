[h1] Reconnection / Config Notes [/h1]
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE!: SERVER mods can only be changed by the HOST on non-caves, non-dedicated servers for now. Also, when SERVER mods are changed, all players except the host will be DISCONNECTED. (We're still trying to fix this...)
Also, you cannot change config options for SERVER mods in-game, so we suggest changing them before loading up your world.

NOTE: If the server is NOT DEDICATED and the HOST only changes [u]client[/u] mods, then the server WILL RELOAD, but the players will not be disconnected.

[h1] Work in Progress [/h1]
[list]
[*]Having clients automatically reconnect to the server when [u]server[/u] mods have been changed.
[*]Adding a "Manage Mods" button to the pause menu.
[*]Making it possible to configure server mod settings from the mod manager.
[*]Changing mods while in caves (at least for changing client mods).
[/list]

[h1] Details of Note [/h1] [olist]
[*] [b]New players will temporarily not be allowed to join the server while the host has the mod manager open.[/b] This is to prevent players from experiencing horrifying glitches upon entering the world. It literally looks like the world is melting into a colorful inferno. Players will be allowed to join again if the host cancels out of the mod manager or applies the changes.
[*] If you try changing a client mod and the game says, "The server is not accepting new connections," then PLEASE WAIT. The mod WILL RECONNECT you. This means that a host is using the mod manager and is temporarily blocking new connections, as stated in the previous point.
[*] Server mods cannot yet be changed in cave-enabled or dedicated servers. These scenarios require more intricate communication between hosts/admins and the servers. [/olist]

This mod might be useful if you're a modder and you're testing a server mod, or if you want to quickly test the compatibility of different mods. Don't forget you can [b]go to the steam workshop directly from the mod manager[/b] if you need to!
